name: spec-drift
description: Compare a persisted specification with current implementation and tests to find covered, uncovered, and drifted criteria. Use for “check spec drift” or “does the code still match this spec?”.

State material concerns, evidence, consequence, and confidence directly. Do not soften blockers, manufacture praise, or claim certainty beyond the evidence.

# Detect specification drift

## Outcome

Produce a read-only criterion-by-criterion report grounded in current code and tests, not in historical approval or stale evidence pointers.

## Workflow

1. Read the spec from `spec_file_path` and validate it with `shared/schemas/spec@1.json`. Report an unset path as a coverage gap rather than silently using a stale pasted copy.
2. Inspect current implementation, tests, public interfaces, and relevant runtime behavior for each criterion. Use prior `criteria_evidence` only as a starting location.
3. Classify each criterion as `covered`, `uncovered`, or `drifted`. Cite the current file and line or test result that supports the classification.
4. Separate missing verification from behavioral drift. A test absence is not proof that behavior is absent.
5. Return the report without changing code or the spec. Recommend `scribe:correct-spec` only when the spec itself conflicts with verified reality.

## Contract

- Input schema: `shared/schemas/spec@1.json`
- Input location: `spec_file_path`, normally `docs/specs/<id>.json`
- Output: read-only drift report with per-criterion evidence

## Teams and fallback

Before delegating, read `agent-roles/README.md`; use `reviewer` for a non-overlapping criterion group and reconcile classifications in the primary agent.

For a wide spec, team members may inspect independent criterion groups with fixed file scopes. The primary agent owns final classification consistency. Smaller audits run completely in one agent.

## Boundaries

- Do not modify implementation, tests, or the persisted spec during diagnosis.
- Keep command output and scripts out of the thread as `shared/references/tooling/context.md` says.
- Do not treat documentation claims as proof that a criterion is implemented.
