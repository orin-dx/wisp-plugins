## Authoring a New Plugin

The fastest way to scaffold a new plugin is with the `mason` plugin:

```
"Create a plugin called <id> that does <goal>"
```

`scaffolder` generates the full directory structure, `plugin.json`, `SKILL.md`, and stub subagent files. Run `auditor` afterward to verify conformance.

To scaffold manually:

```bash
mkdir -p plugins/<id>/skills/<id> plugins/<id>/agents
ln -s ../../shared plugins/<id>/shared
```

Then create `plugin.json`, `skills/<id>/SKILL.md`, and `agents/*.md` following the conventions below.

---

## Plugin Structure

```
plugins/<id>/
├── plugin.json
├── README.md
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── skills/<id>/SKILL.md
└── agents/
    ├── scanner.md       (sonnet/medium — pattern matching)
    ├── worker.md        (sonnet/medium — analysis)
    ├── adversary.md     (opus/high — adversarial reasoning)
    └── exit-gate.md     (opus/high — final judgment)
```

Organize agents by **cognitive mode**, not pipeline position. A scan agent and an analysis agent require different mental modes — split them even if they run sequentially. Agent files are never prefixed with the plugin id (`worker.md`, not `my-plugin-worker.md`) — Claude Code already namespaces agents as `<plugin_id>:<agent_name>`, so a prefix produces redundant `my-plugin:my-plugin-worker` stuttering. See `shared/agent-best-practices.md`'s Namespacing Rule.

A plugin defaults to this single-skill layout. IF its scope covers several genuinely independent, heterogeneous intents on the same artifact — not a linear pipeline invoked as one flow — `skills/<id>/` may split into `skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md` per skill instead (see `courier`, `scribe`, `weaver`, `mason`). A new skill name defaults to a single lifecycle-stage word; go to a specific compound name (`audit-spec`, not `scribe-audit`) only when the bare word is ambiguous or collides with another plugin's existing skill name — never resolve a collision by prefixing the plugin id, since `plugin:skill` invocation already disambiguates that. See `shared/constitution.md`'s Plugin Structure and Skill Names sections.

### `plugin.json`

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "One sentence.",
  "author": {
    "name": "Gabriel Castro",
    "email": "gabe@techworx.dev"
  },
  "skills": "./skills/",
  "agents": ["./agents/recon.md", "./agents/worker.md", "./agents/exit-gate.md"]
}
```

`skills` is always the path string `"./skills/"` — the loader discovers every `SKILL.md` under it, whether that's one directory or several. `agents` is the explicit list of agent file paths; every file listed must exist, and every file present must be listed (`mason`'s `auditor` checks this).

### `SKILL.md`

The skill prompt is what the user invokes. It should:

- Have a concise frontmatter `description` covering when to activate the skill, its input, its output, and key constraints
- Describe the agent pipeline: which subagents run in what order, and what each returns
- Reference shared schemas by exact relative path
- Use the shortest direct wording that preserves each action, condition, evidence requirement, and consequence

## Agent Authoring Checklist

Read `shared/agent-best-practices.md` before authoring. The hard requirements:

### 5-part structure (frontmatter + body)

- [ ] **Constitution** — copied byte-for-byte from an existing agent, never authored fresh. See `shared/constitution.md`'s Static Prompt Prefix Invariant.
- [ ] **Backstory** — 2–4 sentences. What has this agent been burned by? What does it value? Guides judgment without constraining method.
- [ ] **Goal** — what the agent must produce and why. Intent, not steps.
- [ ] **Judgment** — how to tell if the goal was genuinely achieved vs. output that merely looks like it was. Name the key failure mode.
- [ ] **Output** — structured shape; reference a schema from `shared/schemas/` when output flows to another agent.

No `<role>` section in the body — that's what `<backstory>` replaced. The frontmatter `role:` field is platform metadata (short display label for routing) and should be kept. No `success_criteria:` checklist. No filler: "your job is to", "make sure to", "please ensure".

### Instruction economy

- [ ] Each paragraph or list item contains one independently actionable rule
- [ ] Sub-bullets express real branches, evidence, or attributes rather than split a long sentence cosmetically
- [ ] Numbered steps are reserved for operations whose order affects correctness
- [ ] Repeated rationale, process narration, filler, and synonymous restatement are removed
- [ ] Non-obvious context appears once, at the decision it changes
- [ ] Bodies over 300 words and list items over 40 words are reviewed, not automatically rejected
- [ ] Material concerns state evidence, consequence, and confidence directly; blockers are not softened and praise is not manufactured

### Progressive context loading

- [ ] Declares one `<load_first>` block naming only the focused `shared/references/` files needed for this agent's phase
- [ ] Does not load reference files outside its cognitive mode (scanner loads hazards, not smells)
- [ ] Places references under the cognitive concern; uses language filenames only for language-specific evidence
- [ ] Keeps human indexes out of runtime load chains
- [ ] For Codex, every exact `shared/` path loaded directly or transitively appears in `harnesses/codex/catalog.json`; historical mentions omit the path when runtime access is unnecessary

### EARS placement

- [ ] EARS notation (`WHEN`, `IF`, `WHILE`, `WHERE`) used only in output contracts and never-do rules
- [ ] No EARS in implementation steps, search strategies, or reasoning guidance

### Model and effort

- [ ] `haiku` / `low` — deterministic enumeration only (manifest building, file inventory)
- [ ] `sonnet` / `medium` — analysis (scanning, drafting, planning, tracing)
- [ ] `opus` / `high` — judgment (adversarial reasoning, exit gates, final verdicts)

### Tool language

- [ ] Uses abstract tool language: "use your file reading tool", "use your search tool"
- [ ] No tool-specific calls (`view_file`, `read_file`, `grep_search`, etc.)
- [ ] No absolute paths

### Schema conformance

- [ ] If the output is a named schema (e.g. `finding-report@2`), every field in the output shape is declared in `shared/schemas/` — no undeclared fields, no missing required fields

### Verification evidence

- [ ] Behavioral claims name evidence that can falsify them; tool invocation alone is not evidence
- [ ] Generative checks name the generator and oracle
- [ ] Semantic sibling searches derive candidates from domain responsibility, state transitions, and architecture, then record each outcome
- [ ] External or asynchronous checks use fresh state and terminal results
- [ ] Unsupported or disproportionate checks are recorded as coverage gaps

### Runtime reference quality

- [ ] States the outcome and condition that make the reference useful
- [ ] Treats heuristics as candidate signals and names evidence that confirms or refutes them
- [ ] Prescribes implementation or order only when correctness, safety, or protocol sequence requires it
- [ ] Derives abstractions from live architecture instead of importing project-specific names
- [ ] Covers every language or platform it claims, or states the missing target as a coverage gap
- [ ] Uses word and line thresholds as review signals rather than proof of poor quality

## Adding a Shared Schema

Shared schemas in `shared/schemas/` are the inter-plugin API. To add one:

1. Create `shared/schemas/<name>@<version>.json` using JSON Schema draft-2020-12
2. Set `additionalProperties: false`
3. Include a `reasoning: string` field
4. Document which plugin produces it and which consume it
5. **Never modify an existing versioned schema** — create `<name>@<version+1>.json` instead

---

## Registering in `marketplace.json`

Add an entry to the `"plugins"` array:

```json
{
  "id": "my-plugin",
  "name": "my-plugin",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "path": "./plugins/my-plugin",
  "description": "One sentence description. Skills: skill-one, skill-two."
}
```

## Capability Change Checklist

For a change spanning Claude/AGY and Codex, read [`shared/harness-authoring.md`](./shared/harness-authoring.md) first. It defines which concerns are shared, which are native, and the counterpart-review record required before release.

When you add or change what an existing agent can do — a new dimension, a new output status, a new default posture — the code change alone leaves the ecosystem inconsistent. Work through this list in the same change:

- [ ] Frontmatter `description` reflects the new capability
- [ ] If the agent's output gained a new status/enum value, the plugin's `SKILL.md` names what the caller does with it — or states it's terminal
- [ ] New references live under the reader's concern, have a real caller, and update `shared/references/README.md` when they introduce a concern
- [ ] If runtime reference behavior changed, every consuming Claude/AGY and Codex route was reviewed and affected plugin versions were updated
- [ ] Every prose description still matches the agent's current behavior:
  - Plugin README subagent and output-schema sections
  - SKILL.md overview, dispatch, and I/O sections
  - Narrowed or corrected capabilities, not only additions
- [ ] Plugin `CHANGELOG.md` gets a new dated entry
- [ ] `plugin.json` version bumped (see `shared/references/delivery/changesets.md`)
- [ ] Root `marketplace.json`'s matching plugin entry version bumped to the same value
- [ ] `mason:scaffolder` and `mason:auditor` reflect any new structural convention; capability-only changes need no Mason update

This isn't automated. `mason:audit-plugin` checks structural conformance; it does not (yet) check that every downstream doc/version file was updated to match a capability change. Until it does, this checklist is the thing standing between "the agent works" and "the ecosystem knows the agent works."

---

## Engineering Invariants

- **No absolute paths:** prompt and skill paths are relative.
- **Self-contained subagents:** each prompt is readable in isolation and has no dependency on another agent's private prompt.
- **Pull, don't inject:** subagents load `shared/references/` on demand; the host does not preload them.
- **Authoring-only guidance:** never load `shared/agent-best-practices.md` at runtime.
- **Abstract tool language:** keep prompts portable across harnesses.
- **Conventional commits:** use the applicable type and plugin scope.
- **Clean writing:** omit AI filler, marketing language, and non-warning ALL CAPS.
- **Diagrams:** follow `shared/references/authoring/diagrams.md` when Mermaid materially clarifies a relationship.

## Development Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/orin-dx/wisp-plugins.git
cd wisp-plugins

# Install pinned documentation-check dependencies (just and pnpm must be on PATH)
just install

# Run every check
just check
```

`just --list` shows each check as its own recipe (`just versions`, `just mermaid`, and so on) for running a subset while editing; a Mermaid syntax error is invisible to every other check — it's still valid markdown, `jq` never touches it, and it reads fine as source, so `just mermaid` is worth running on its own after touching a diagram. `just fmt` formats the repo in place with `oxfmt`; `just fmt-check` only verifies. Neither is part of `just check` yet — the repo doesn't have a baseline format pass, so `fmt-check` would fail on unrelated files today.

Before a `git commit`, the repository-local Claude and Codex hook checks immutable schema versions and Codex generated-output freshness. See [`docs/repository-hooks.md`](./docs/repository-hooks.md).

`just check` runs automatically in CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) on every PR and every push to `main`.
