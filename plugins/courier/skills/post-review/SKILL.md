# Courier — Post Review

<overview>
Posting a review comment is a visible, external, hard-to-reverse action — the kind this repo's action-safety guidance already requires confirmation for. There is no subagent here: drafting a critique is a judgment task owned by `code-review` (quality) and `sentinel` (spec conformance), and drafting a reply is owned by `courier/receive-feedback`'s response plan or the user directly. This skill's only job is the mechanical last step — show exactly what will be posted and where, get explicit confirmation, then run the `gh` command.
</overview>

<dispatch>
No subagent. Orchestration only: assemble the exact comment/review body and target (PR number, thread ID if replying) from the input, present it verbatim to the user, and on confirmation run `gh pr review <number> --body "..."` or `gh pr comment <number> --body "..."`.

<io>
**Consumes**: drafted review/reply text and its target (PR number, optionally thread ID), from `code-review`, `courier/receive-feedback`, or the user directly
**Produces**: posted GitHub review or comment. NEVER post without showing the exact text and target to the user first and getting explicit confirmation — this is an irreversible, other-visible action.
