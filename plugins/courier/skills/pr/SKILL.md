# Courier — PR

<overview>
Produces a PR title and body from a diff plus optional linked spec/requirement, then opens the PR. Delegates the narrative to `pr-narrator`; opening the PR is a visible external action and always requires explicit confirmation before the `gh pr create` call fires.

<dispatch>
| Agent | Model / Effort | Delegate When |

| **pr-narrator** | sonnet / medium | A PR needs a title and body a reviewer with zero context can act on. |

<io>
**Consumes**: git diff, optionally linked `spec@1` or `requirement@1`
**Produces**: opened PR (title, body, labels). Confirm the drafted title/body with the user before running `gh pr create` — this is a shared-visibility action, not a local one.
