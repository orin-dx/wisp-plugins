description: >-
  Trigger when the user asks whether a spec matches its source: "is this grounded?", "does this spec match the requirement?", "check this spec against the requirement". Given a draft spec@1, the requirement@1, and optional research-report@1, classifies criteria as supported, unsupported, or overfitted. Evidence only, no verdict; use before implementation.

# Scribe — Verify Spec

<overview>
Confirms a spec draft actually traces back to what the requirement (and research, if any) asked for — not whether the spec reads well, that's `scribe/audit-spec`'s job. Delegates to `verifier`, a neutral evidence collector with no pass/fail authority.

| Agent | Model / Effort | Delegate When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **verifier** | sonnet / medium | A draft spec@1 needs each acceptance criterion checked against its source requirement/research-report for grounding. |
