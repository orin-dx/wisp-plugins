description: >-
  Use when a finding-report@2, implementation-review@2 or implementation-result@1 identifies a structural defect class, or the same kind of defect keeps recurring: "make this class of bug impossible". Produces the smallest spec@1 that makes recurrence impossible or machine-detectable through a type, API, boundary, invariant, lint, test or CI rule.

# Scribe — Architect

<overview>
Turn confirmed defect families into enforceable structural specs. Route every output through verify-spec, audit-spec, audit-architecture, and gate-spec before planning.

**Consumes**: `finding-report@2`, `implementation-review@2`, or an architecture-escalating `implementation-result@1`.

**Produces**: one `spec@1` per structural boundary. Route through the full Scribe checks, Navigator, and Smith; after implementation passes, refresh the persisted architecture model.
