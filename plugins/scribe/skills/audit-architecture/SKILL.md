  Use when a draft spec@1 should be checked against whole-system architecture before scribe/gate-spec: "check this spec against our architecture", "does this fit the system", "audit this against the arch model". Checks it against the persisted arch-model@2 (building or refreshing it if absent or stale) and returns specific rewritten fixes on fail.

# Scribe — Audit Architecture

<overview>
Closes the gap `scribe/audit-spec` leaves open: a spec can be internally consistent — testable criteria, no TBDs, no vague language — and still be wrong for the system it's joining. Delegates to `arch-auditor`. Runs after `scribe/audit-spec` and before `scribe/gate-spec`, so a spec doesn't reach the binding gate without a system-scope check, not just a spec-scope one.
</overview>

<dispatch>
| Agent | Model / Effort | Delegate When |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **arch-auditor** | claude-fable-5-1 / high | A spec@1 (post `scribe/audit-spec`) needs checking against the workspace's persisted architecture model before `scribe/gate-spec`. Also invoked directly in build mode to construct or refresh the model on demand. |

<orchestration>
WHEN `arch-auditor` runs in build mode and returns an `arch-model@2`, THE SKILL SHALL write it to `<workspace_root>/docs/architecture/model.json` (creating the directory if absent) and commit it — the model is maintained state, not a per-id gated artifact, so a build/refresh pass overwrites the same file rather than creating a new one. An uncommitted model is invisible to a future session on the same terms as an uncommitted spec or plan.

Check mode produces no disk write of its own — it only reads the existing model.
</orchestration>

<io>
**Consumes**: `spec@1` (post-audit-spec), the persisted `arch-model@2` at `docs/architecture/model.json` if present
**Produces**: `arch-audit@1` in check mode (route to `scribe/gate-spec` on pass, back to `scribe/draft-spec` on fail — same 2-round circuit breaker as `scribe/audit-spec`); `arch-model@2` in build mode, persisted per the orchestration above
</io>
