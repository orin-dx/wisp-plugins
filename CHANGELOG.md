# Changelog

All notable changes to the Wisp Plugins ecosystem are documented here.
Individual plugin changelogs live in `plugins/<plugin-id>/CHANGELOG.md`.

## [4.6.0] - 2026-11-14 — Two rounds and one reality check

- Exit gates and the plan challenger get two rounds; after a second failing round, or a repeated blocker, the decision goes to a human (ADR 015, amends ADR 012's cap of three).
- Spec drafters self-check and the gate judges; auditor, verifier and architecture audit run on request or for shared or cross-module specs. Spec gates check claims against the code, build or spec they cite.
- Implementation review runs once per batch; mutation is skipped when a batch changes no executable logic.
- Gates, reviewers and verifiers count only behavior run with real inputs as evidence that logic works; visual changes are checked in the built page where a browser exists.
- Pipeline agents' descriptions name the skill that starts them, so the skill's checks run; resident description text is about 27% smaller.

## [4.5.0] - 2026-11-10 — Exploration modes, enforced gates, layered changesets

- Added exploration modes: `muse/sketch`, `muse/promote`, `smith/spike` and the `explorer` agent, with `option-set@1` and `spike-report@1` (ADR 011). Exploration never gates and enters the pipeline only through `promote`.
- Gate output is checked by a hook in the five gate plugins, including the retry cap (ADR 012). Exit gates list the complete blocker set in round one and drafters self-check (ADR 013).
- Plans state outcomes and contracts and carry code only where it earns its cost (ADR 014, partially supersedes ADR 009).
- Courier writes layered changesets without a length cap: `changeset@3` and `release-artifact@3`; `commit-analyzer` and `pr-narrator` follow the repository's own conventions.
- The `muse` gate returns `verdict@3`; a light `smith` entry handles review findings; a hazard reference covers scripts, CI workflows and templates.
- Agent and skill descriptions are about half the size, skills lead with the request they serve, and shared references load from the plugin root so agents find them on the first read.
- The two `claude-fable-5-1` agents (`scribe:arch-auditor`, `scribe:architect`) and the Codex `judge` role (`gpt-6-astra`) move one tier down (`opus / high`, `gpt-6.1-sol / high`) for cost; no heavier tier is defined. The Codex `author` role uses `gpt-6.1-terra / medium`.
- Marketplace sources are relative paths, so installed plugins include their shared schemas and references.

## [4.4.5] - 2026-09-27 — Architecture model decision links

- Added `arch-model@2`: invariants may cite a `decision_ref` naming the governing decision record. `arch-model@1` unchanged; an existing persisted model needs no migration.
- Trimmed all 10 plugin CHANGELOGs for scannability — no behavior change.

## [4.4.4] - 2026-09-27 — Language-service evidence

- Restored Smith's language-service evidence guidance (LSP diagnostics count as supporting boundary evidence only with recorded backend identity/version and capability match), lost during the prior release and recovered from session history.

## [4.4.3] - 2026-09-27 — Decision records and AGENTS.md consolidation

- Added a decision-record convention (`shared/references/architecture/decision-records.md`) and a `docs/adr/` index with a guardrail per record, checked by a new reference-integrity test.
- Removed `CLAUDE.md`; `AGENTS.md` is now the sole source of truth for every harness.
- Ranger's adversary sweep follows `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`'s `@` imports and the nearest nested instruction file.
- Comment guidance routes a structural alternative not taken to a decision record instead of the PR body.
- Switched repository tooling from `npm` to `pnpm`/`just`, and added `oxfmt`; CI updated to match.
- Fixed `check-mermaid`'s hard dependency on a locally-installed `rg`, which failed unconditionally in CI.

## [4.4.2] - 2026-09-10 — Concern-first reference routing

- Reorganized shared references by cognitive concern, with language as the filename only for language-specific evidence. Removed four redundant language indexes.
- Updated Claude/AGY and Codex runtime paths, catalogs, authoring docs, and generated packaging inputs together.
- Added CI coverage for broken exact paths, local Markdown links, retired pointer forms, immutable-path replacements, and runtime references with no caller.
- Mermaid validation now reports renderer and network failures when no parser error is present.
- Corrected Navigator's Codex workflow to apply the same syntax-and-architecture interface coverage as its Claude/AGY challenger.
- Replaced stale claims about grep-only scanning and deterministic implementer discovery with the evidence-led behavior the references require; Ranger now names every selectable hazard path exactly.
- Corrected Sentinel's verdict-schema link and clarified that one `<load_first>` block may select the smallest relevant set of focused references.

## [4.4.1] - 2026-09-09 — Direct, evidence-led guidance

- Added a shared radical-candor rule: report material concerns with evidence, consequence, and calibrated confidence; do not soften blockers or manufacture praise.
- Reframed runtime references around outcomes, applicability, confirming and refuting evidence, and explicit dispositions. Ordered procedures remain only where sequence affects correctness.
- Reworked Rust and TypeScript hazard, architecture, and tooling references to avoid universal style rules and predetermined designs; aligned Python and Go packs with the same evidence standard.
- Updated Courier's PR guidance and GitHub template to report observed verification, disclose gaps, and omit empty ceremony.
- Updated Mason to scaffold and audit reference quality, cross-language claims, and candid evidence.
- Added a non-blocking density warning for references over 800 words while retaining the 120-line hard cap.

## [4.4.0] - 2026-09-09 — Evidence-depth and behavioral evaluation

- Added risk-matched verification rules for real execution boundaries, structured-input generators and oracles, fresh external state, and terminal asynchronous results. Mutation, property, fuzz, race, integration, and boundary tools remain project-native options rather than mandatory rituals.
- Added Python and Go hazard, boundary, architecture-smell, and tooling references beside the existing Rust and TypeScript/JavaScript packs.
- Added `workspace-manifest@1`, `implementation-result@1`, `mutation-report@2`, `implementation-review@2`, `candidate-assessment@1`, `finding-report@2`, and `verdict@3`. The contracts expose capabilities, semantic-sibling candidates, boundary and input-space evidence, structural families, gaps, pending checks, and provenance.
- Smith 2.4.0 and Ranger 3.2.0 adopt the new contracts. Scribe 3.3.0 consumes their structural escalations. Sentinel 2.1.0 returns scoped verdicts.
- Added `mason:evaluate` in Mason 3.2.0. It preserves isolated run evidence as `evaluation-run@1`, then records `harness-evaluation@2` after revealing the hidden oracle; prose and tool invocation receive no score.
- Added a four-language behavioral fixture covering non-syntactic siblings, compiled process boundaries, non-vacuous generated inputs, and fresh asynchronous or external state.
- Added Entire-managed repository-history search adapters for Codex, Claude, Cursor, Gemini, and OpenCode, including native Cursor and OpenCode lifecycle integration.
- Updated root architecture, Claude and cross-harness authoring guidance, shared-reference maps, plugin output docs, and contract descriptions to match the released workflows.

## [4.3.0] - 2026-09-09 — Instruction economy and defect-family review

- Added direct, atomic authoring rules with outcome-based guidance for judgment and ordered steps only where sequence affects correctness. Mason now scaffolds and audits the convention.
- Added `implementation-review@1`, a cross-harness contract for lineage, positive or negative sibling-search evidence, defect families, model and architecture assessments, and consistent disposition status.
- Smith blocks unresolved families and commits only with explicit authorization. Ranger groups related findings before remediation. Scribe consumes structural escalations and refreshes the architecture model after implementation.
- Added phase-specific reference routers for implementation review and structural remediation, preserving language and architecture evidence without preloading unrelated guidance.
- Codex reference-closure validation now treats exact shared paths as runtime dependencies. Courier 3.0.1 packages the transitive voice guide without packaging a historical legacy schema mention.

### Codex marketplace and cross-harness authoring

Adds a second installable harness, Codex, alongside Claude Code/AGY, without pretending the two runtimes are interchangeable. Classification: distribution + shared contract additions.

- **New**: `harnesses/codex/` — independently-authored Codex-native skills and eight portable role cards (`recon`, `tracer`, `research`, `author`, `implementer`, `adversary`, `reviewer`, `judge`) for every plugin, matched to each plugin's shared identity (id/version/author) but not a mechanical translation of Claude prompts, model tiers, or delegation topology.
- **New**: `tools/build-codex-marketplace.py` generates the `dist/codex` bundle plus the repository-root `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json` discovery manifest from `plugins/*/plugin.json`, `harnesses/codex/`, and `shared/schemas/`. Never hand-edit generated artifacts. `--check` verifies both are in sync (deterministic, byte-identical native sources, no symlinks, no version/author drift) — this is now a CI gate and a pre-release gate.
- **New**: `scripts/authoring-integrity-hook.py`, wired into both `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` as a `PreToolUse`/`Bash` guard — blocks a `git commit` that mutates an existing versioned schema in place (instead of adding a new version) or leaves `dist/codex` stale relative to its sources.
- **New schemas**: `shared/schemas/codex-adaptation@1.json` (the generated marketplace's own manifest shape), `shared/schemas/harness-evaluation@1.json` (behavioral-parity evaluation records, see below).
- **New docs**: `shared/harness-authoring.md` (the design boundary and change procedure for anything touching both harnesses), `docs/codex-marketplace-release-policy.md` (what's portable, the release procedure, the CI gates), `docs/codex-behavioral-evaluation.md` (how to evaluate whether a Codex-native workflow produces durable, evidence-led artifacts comparable to the Claude source — not identical prose or transcripts), `docs/repository-hooks.md` (documents the commit-time integrity guard above).
- **New tests**: `tests/test_build_codex_marketplace.py`, `tests/test_cross_harness_artifacts.py`, `tests/test_codex_native_sources.py`, `tests/test_authoring_integrity_hook.py`, `tests/test_codex_behavioral_evaluation.py` — now run in CI (`.github/workflows/validate.yml`) alongside the existing manifest/version/skill-doc checks.
- **Changed**: every plugin `README.md` gained a Codex install line (`codex plugin add <id>@wisp-plugins`, after registering the marketplace with `codex plugin marketplace add orin-dx/agent-plugins`) — doc-only, no plugin behavior change, no version bump for the 9 plugins whose only change is this line.
- **Changed**: `mason` (3.0.0→3.0.1) — `audit-plugin` and `scaffold-plugin` now cite `shared/harness-authoring.md` when a plugin has or will have a Codex-native source; this is a real (if small) capability change to mason's own conformance/scaffolding logic, not just a Codex-side distribution addition, so it gets its own bump — see `plugins/mason/CHANGELOG.md`.
- **Not changed**: no other plugin's `plugin.json` version bumped. Each plugin's shared identity (id, version, author in `plugin.json`) is the contract Codex's native manifest must match, not something that changes because a Codex-native implementation was added alongside it — `test_codex_native_sources.py` enforces this (`test_rejects_native_version_drift`).

Verification: `python3 -m unittest discover tests -v`, `python3 tools/build-codex-marketplace.py --check`. See `docs/codex-marketplace-release-policy.md` for the full release procedure.

### Ecosystem brand becomes Wisp Plugins

Docs-only. The ten-plugin family is now branded **Wisp Plugins**; **Wisp** alone refers to the `orin-axi/wisp` project-intelligence library the plugins consume. No plugin ids, skill names, versions, or schemas change. See `docs/adr/010-wisp-plugins-brand.md`.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-09-01 — Implementer shape latitude, compilation-boundary task sizing

`smith` (2.2.0) and `navigator` (2.2.0): `planner`'s exact implementation code is now a concrete baseline `smith`'s implementer may adapt in shape (not scope) at execution time, with deviations recorded transparently — fixing an over-prescription pattern that echoed the same premature-shape-locking problem the previous release fixed for tests. Task sizing changed from a "under fifteen minutes" clock-time estimate to compilation-boundary cohesion, resolving a standing inconsistency with `shared/agent-best-practices.md`'s own batching rule. Also bulletized `implementer`'s `<judgment>` section, missed in the prior ecosystem-wide pass. See `docs/adr/009-implementer-shape-latitude.md`.

## [4.1.0] - 2026-09-01 — Drop mandatory write-test-first ordering

`smith` (2.1.0) and `navigator` (2.1.0): dropped the requirement that a task's test be written and confirmed failing before its implementation. Tasks now specify a brief implementation approach, the exact implementation, and the exact tests proving each criterion — test quality is verified by `smith`'s existing mutation-testing gate, not by write order. Rationale is a controlled comparison finding no quality advantage from write-test-first ordering for agent-written code, at several times the token cost, and that it suppressed upfront design work agents otherwise did well. See `docs/adr/008-drop-test-first-ordering.md`.

## [4.0.0] - 2026-08-27 — Wisp Persona Rename

**BREAKING**: All 9 plugin ids renamed to persona/craft-role names under the umbrella brand **Wisp**, memorability having broken down once the ecosystem passed 9 abstract math-noun ids. A 10th plugin, `muse` (component specification), was added in the same pass. Each plugin's own `plugin.json` `id`/`name` was bumped to its next major version; every cross-plugin reference across agents, skills, shared references, shared schemas, and root docs was updated to match. See `docs/adr/007-wisp-persona-naming.md` for the full rationale.

| Old id | New id | New version |
|---|---|---|
| `graph` | `weaver` | 3.0.0 |
| `trace` | `vanguard` | 2.0.0 |
| `canon` | `scribe` | 3.0.0 |
| `vector` | `navigator` | 2.0.0 |
| `lambda` | `smith` | 2.0.0 |
| `proof` | `ranger` | 3.0.0 |
| `axiom` | `sentinel` | 2.0.0 |
| `delta` | `courier` | 3.0.0 |
| `basis` | `mason` | 3.0.0 |
| *(new)* | `muse` | 1.0.0 |

Single-skill plugins also renamed their skill from the old plugin id to a literal action word: `proof/proof` → `ranger/audit`, `trace/trace` → `vanguard/research`, `vector/vector` → `navigator/plan`, `axiom/axiom` → `sentinel/gate`, `lambda/lambda` → `smith/implement`. Multi-skill plugins (`weaver`, `scribe`, `courier`, `mason`) kept their existing skill names — only the plugin-id prefix changed.

## [3.5.3] - 2026-08-23 — Full-Repo Sweep

`v3.5.2`'s adversarial re-read only covered files touched this session. This pass extended the same scrutiny repo-wide, since the user asked whether *all* plugins — not just the touched ones — are conformant, succinct, and accurate. Ran fresh mechanical checks (constitution byte-identity, section order, banned words, description word counts) across all 38 agents, and two targeted audits: `axiom` (never touched or reviewed all session) and a cross-check of both marketplaces plus every plugin CHANGELOG against actual `plugin.json` state.

### Fixed
- **`axiom` (v1.2.3)**: `skills/axiom/SKILL.md` linked the authoring-time-only `shared/agent-best-practices.md` — a copy-paste leftover from scaffolding with no runtime purpose for a verification gate.
- **`basis` (v2.1.2)**: `auditor`'s "no authoring-time refs" check only scanned agent bodies, not `SKILL.md` files — the exact gap that let the `axiom` issue above ship unnoticed. Broadened the check to also scan `SKILL.md`, with `basis`'s own scaffolding skills carved out as the one legitimate exception.
- **`trace` (v1.2.5)**: README's "When to Use" bullet used the banned word "landscape."

### Verified, not changed
- Both `proof` and `lambda`'s one-line marketplace descriptions don't mention this session's newest capabilities (the `plausible` verdict path, `needs_architecture`). Left as-is — both marketplace files already agree with each other and with each plugin's own `plugin.json`, and the existing convention already omits other major features at this altitude (e.g. `lambda`'s blurb never mentioned mutation testing either). Padding every one-liner to stay current would fight this repo's own succinctness rule, not serve it.

## [3.5.2] - 2026-08-23 — Adversarial Re-Read

Four parallel adversarial passes re-read every file touched in `v3.4.0` and `v3.5.x`, explicitly hunting for contradictions rather than confirming things looked fine. Two of the four came back clean. Two surfaced real, fixable defects — one pre-existing, one introduced by this session's own `v3.5.0`/`v3.5.1` work:

### Fixed
- **`lambda` (v1.6.2)**: the `needs_architecture` → `finding-report@1` field mapping in `SKILL.md` omitted the schema's required `id` and `description` fields — a caller following it literally would produce a schema-invalid finding.
- **`proof` (v2.2.4)**: `exit-gate`'s output never conformed to `verdict@1.json` — wrong verdict enum, an entirely invalid blocker shape, and (new in `v2.2.3`) a `flagged_for_review` field with no schema counterpart. Added `verdict@2.json` (verdict@1 plus optional `flagged_for_review`) and rewrote `exit-gate` to conform to it literally. `axiom`, `canon`, and `lambda` are unaffected.
- **`basis` (v2.1.1)**: `auditor`'s frontmatter claimed a check count that disagreed with its own README table, and one check the README promised (no authoring-time references to `shared/agent-best-practices.md`) was never actually instructed anywhere in the agent's `<output>`.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: the new Capability Change Checklist (added in `v3.5.0`) had no bullet for "descriptive prose still matches actual behavior" — exactly the defect class that motivated writing the checklist in the first place. Added one.

## [3.5.1] - 2026-08-23 — Missed Instance

### Fixed
- **`trace` (v1.2.4)**: `recon` still claimed to map "specs, plans, docs" as research sources — missed in `v3.5.0`'s own pass despite that pass touching this same file for its `<load_first>` addition. `plan@1` is never persisted to disk. Found by re-checking for the exact phrase across the repo rather than trusting the earlier sweep was exhaustive.

## [3.5.0] - 2026-08-23 — Basis Conformance Overhaul & Cross-Plugin Doc Accuracy

A follow-up audit across the six plugins not touched in `v3.4.0` (`graph`, `trace`, `delta`, `axiom`, `proof`, `basis`) found the same class of gap recurring — `basis`, the meta-plugin meant to keep every other agent conformant, had itself fallen behind twice: it couldn't generate or check `<load_first>` (a real CONTRIBUTING.md requirement since before this session), and had no check for orchestration completeness (an agent's output status with no SKILL.md routing) — the exact defect fixed by hand in `lambda` this session. Root `CHANGELOG.md`'s own `v3.3.0` entry already documents this happening once before. This release fixes the specific findings and the root cause.

### Added
- **`basis` (v2.1.0)**: `scaffolder` generates `<load_first>` and drafts SKILL.md routing entries; `auditor` gained `<load_first>`-correctness and orchestration-completeness checks, and now runs the repo's own validation scripts for what they already check deterministically instead of re-deriving it through reasoning.
- **`proof` (v2.2.3)**: `adversary` gained a genuine `plausible` verdict path (the schema promised this since it was written; adversary was strictly binary). `exit-gate` gained `flagged_for_review` to carry plausible findings for human review without blocking on them.
- **`shared/references/workspace-conventions.md`**: consolidates the "gated specs live at `.claude/specs/*.json`" fact, now cited by `canon:auditor`, `graph:auditor`, and `trace:recon` instead of restated three times.
- **`shared/constitution.md`**: new rule — a new agent-authoring convention must update `basis:scaffolder`/`basis:auditor` in the same change, or it's documented, not enforced.
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: new Capability Change Checklist — the full list of docs/versions a capability change touches, distilled from this session's own work.
- **`.github/workflows/validate.yml`**, **`CONTRIBUTING.md`**: `scripts/check-reference-size.sh` was written and documented in `CLAUDE.md` but wired into neither CI nor the local dev-setup command list. Added to both.

### Fixed
- **`delta` (v2.1.3)**: `receive-feedback` and its own `README.md` claimed automated must-fix/suggestion/question comment triage in 6 places; `review-preprocessor`'s own `<judgment>` explicitly forbids that call. Narrowed to what it does — package assembly.
- **`graph` (v2.0.2)**: `auditor` (and its SKILL.md/README) claimed to search "specs, plans, and implementation" for coverage; `plan@1` is never persisted to disk, so the claim was unfulfillable. Scoped to specs and implementation.
- **`trace` (v1.2.3)**: `synthesizer`'s `<output>` now shows a literal JSON template matching its three siblings, instead of prose-only.
- **`canon` (v2.2.1)**, **`graph`**, **`trace`**: each agent's own restatement of the spec-location fact replaced with a citation to the new shared reference.
- **`lambda` (v1.6.1)**: `needs_architecture` (added in `v1.6.0`) had no SKILL.md routing, unlike its `needs_context`/`spec_contradiction` siblings — added the same re-entry sequence.

## [3.4.0] - 2026-08-23 — Shift-Left Defect Checks

### Added
- **`vector` (v1.5.0)**: `challenger` gained an eighth review dimension, `interface-incompleteness` — a task touching one implementer of a shared trait/interface/protocol must cover every other known implementer or say why not, checked via a deterministic pre-scan rather than recalled from memory.
- **`canon` (v2.2.0)**: `auditor` gained a seventh audit dimension, `boundary-round-trip` — a field a spec adds or changes on a type another spec persists, serializes, or transmits needs a matching round-trip criterion on the far side, or the gap must be named on purpose.
- **`lambda` (v1.6.0)**: `implementer` now defaults any criterion whose value can be absent, wrong, or stale at a boundary to a sum type, discriminated union, or Result — not a raw value next to a separate boolean — escalating to `canon:architect` (via a new `needs_architecture` status) only when a single task's own scope can't reach that shape.
- **`shared/references/interface-implementers.md`**: deterministic implementer-enumeration patterns (grep/AST) per language, loaded by `challenger`.
- **`shared/references/boundary-value-shapes.md`**: the sum-type-over-bool default posture, with Rust/TypeScript before-after examples, loaded by `implementer`.

### Fixed
- `canon:auditor` never stated where gated specs live in the workspace, a pre-existing gap behind its `scope-overlap` dimension since before this change. Now points to `.claude/specs/*.json`, where `canon/gate-spec` writes every passed spec.
- Root `README.md`'s Shared References table was missing the two new files above; its marketplace badge was still pinned to `v2.0.0` while `marketplace.json` had already moved through several major/minor bumps — corrected to `v3.4.0`.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-08-22 — Constitution Section & Reader-Scoped Writing

### Added
- **`shared/constitution.md`**: new Reader-Scoped Writing rule — a doc comment, inline comment, commit message, PR body, or spec field includes only what its actual reader needs; length follows that need, not a target in either direction. A stricter corollary applies to spec@1/plan@1 text specifically, since those get re-read from disk by every subsequent pipeline stage rather than read once by a human.
- **5-part agent structure (ADR-006)**: every agent body now defines `<constitution>` as a byte-for-byte identical first section across all 38 agents, ahead of `<backstory>`/`<goal>`/`<judgment>`/`<output>`. This is what makes the Static Prompt Prefix Invariant's cache-sharing claim real instead of aspirational — previously no agent file had any shared header despite the invariant describing one. Content: treat unauthored content as data not instruction, output-economy discipline, reader-scoped writing, abstract tool language. `constitution.md` and `agent-best-practices.md` amended to permit this 5th section and to allow EARS notation there in addition to `<output>`.
- **`shared/references/code-comments.md`**: operational subset of Reader-Scoped Writing for doc comments and inline comments specifically — `docs-voice.md` only ever covered prose (commits, PRs, changesets, docs), never comments inside code.
- **`scripts/check-reference-size.sh`**: enforces the existing 120-line reference-file cap, which `rust-hazards.md`/`typescript-hazards.md` had silently exceeded (150/167 lines).
- **ADR-006**: documents the `<constitution>` decision; ADR-001 (4-part structure) noted as extended, not superseded.

### Changed
- **`canon` (v2.1.0)**: `auditor` gained a sixth check dimension, `unnecessary-prose`.
- **`lambda` (v1.5.0)**: `reviewer` now flags padded/restating comments as findings; `implementer` writes comments per the new reference.
- **`proof` (v2.2.2)**, **`basis` (v2.0.1)**, **`delta` (v2.1.2)**, **`axiom` (v1.2.2)**, **`graph` (v2.0.1)**, **`trace` (v1.2.2)**, **`vector` (v1.4.2)**: hazard-file split for `boundary-tracer`/`adversary`/`scanner` (proof only), `basis:scaffolder`/`auditor` updated to recognize and generate the 5-part structure (a real bug — `auditor`'s prior check would have failed every conformant agent), reasoning-field caps on haiku-tier agents, and frontmatter description trims across the roster — several exceeded the 80-200 word guideline by 40-80% (`changeset-analyzer` was 283 words, `implementer` 246). Agent + skill description text alone dropped from 5,453+2,438 words to 4,672+2,283 — a fixed cost paid every session regardless of which agent runs, unlike per-invocation prompt content.

### Fixed
- `proof/skills/proof/SKILL.md`'s dispatch matrix mistagged `adversary` as `sonnet/medium`; frontmatter has always been `opus/high`.
- Repo-wide hard-wrap sweep: manually line-wrapped prose (frontmatter `description:` blocks and body paragraphs) unwrapped to single flowing lines across 30+ files, per the standing no-wrap convention — diffs on a wrapped paragraph reflow the whole block for a one-word edit.

## [3.2.1] - 2026-08-21 — Anti-Fragmentation Judgment

### Changed
- **`delta` (v2.1.1)**: `changeset-analyzer`'s topic-splitting judgment (added in 3.2.0) now checks shared `linked_spec`/`linked_plan`/`linked_requirement` first, then explicitly stated shared scope, and only falls back to diff-inferred shared cause when neither applies — guarding against over-fragmenting a deliberately-scoped effort (a themed feature batch, a cross-package testing push) into many tiny changesets. `shared/references/changesets.md` updated to match.

## [3.2.0] - 2026-08-21 — Topic-Scoped Changesets

### Added
- **`delta` (v2.1.0)**: `changeset-analyzer` now checks whether a diff contains multiple independent topics before classifying anything, and emits one `changeset@2` per topic instead of a single bundled entry. A single PR still produces exactly one changeset, unchanged — the new behavior only engages on a backlog/catch-up diff spanning several unrelated tracks since the last release. Prompted by a real incident in a sibling repo (`callisto`, a separate release-automation tool) where a large diff got bundled into one changeset covering unrelated tracks with package attribution guessed from a written summary instead of verified per-topic against the actual diff. `changeset-analyzer`'s output contract changes from a single object to an array of one-or-more; `delta/changeset`'s `<io>` section and `shared/references/changesets.md` updated to match, with the split rule stated as a named failure mode (bundling for convenience costs more than a spurious split).

## [3.1.0] - 2026-08-21 — Honest Sub-Skills, Applied Diagram Palette, Readable READMEs

### Fixed
- `proof`, `vector`, `lambda`, `axiom`, and `trace` each documented a "Sub-skills" table with slash-path names (`proof/scan`, `vector/decompose`, `axiom/verify-plan`, ...) that read exactly like `delta/commit` or `canon/draft-spec` — real, independently invokable skills. None of these five plugins is actually split; each has exactly one skill directory, and those names never routed to anything. `axiom` and `trace` were worse: their own `SKILL.md` and `README.md` each documented two *different*, both-fictional lists that didn't agree with each other. All five replaced with one honest description of the plugin's real pipeline and how it adapts to what's asked, grounded in each plugin's actual agent files.
- `vector`'s README wrongly listed `challenger` as `opus/high`; the agent file says `sonnet/medium`. Corrected.
- `axiom`'s and `trace`'s README version lines were stale — both said `1.0.1` while `plugin.json` was already at `1.2.0`. `proof`'s and `lambda`'s had the same drift (`2.0.0` vs `2.2.0`, `1.2.0` vs `1.4.1`). All corrected.
- `axiom`'s description in both `marketplace.json` and `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` repeated the same fictional six-item sub-skill list — fixed in both.

### Changed
- Applied `orin-visual-standard.md`'s six-color Mermaid palette — documented since this session's earlier work but never actually used anywhere in this repo's own diagrams — to every plugin pipeline diagram plus the root `README.md`/`ARCHITECTURE.md` diagrams. One consistent color-to-role mapping across all of them: indigo for entry points, violet for analysis/engine stages, slate for mechanical/storage roles, amber for routing/judgment decisions, emerald for verified output, rose for failure/escalation.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md`'s axiom-gate-protocol diagram, and `lambda`'s plugin pipeline, now use a subgraph to separate a linear check/loop chain from the retry logic around it — `orin-visual-standard.md`'s Subgraph Styling Spec, defined earlier this session, used for the first time here.
- Several plain-text ASCII pipeline diagrams (`graph`'s hand-aligned box art in particular — fragile, the next label edit would have misaligned it) converted to real Mermaid flowcharts.
- All nine plugin READMEs passed against `docs-voice.md` for scannability: dense paragraphs split into bullets, filler cut, banned words checked.

### Known follow-up, not fixed here
- `lambda`'s skill frontmatter `description` — the text that actually decides when the skill activates, not just its body documentation — still advertises "generate tests," "explain," and "refactor" as request shapes with no agent behind any of them. Left untouched since narrowing live routing behavior deserves its own explicit decision, not a side effect of a docs pass.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-08-21 — Multi-Skill Plugins, Consumer-Scaled Changesets, and a Voice Standard

### Breaking Changes
- `delta`, `canon`, `graph`, and `basis` each split their single broad skill into targeted, independently-triggered skills (22 total). `/delta:ship`, `/canon:canon`, `/graph:graph`, and `/basis:basis` are gone.
- `changeset@1` and `release-artifact@1` are superseded by `changeset@2`/`release-artifact@2`, which add required `consumer_impact` and `semver_impact` fields. `@1` remain on disk and valid — new consumers should target `@2`.

### Architectural Rule Changes
- Plugin Structure now explicitly allows multiple skill directories per plugin (`skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md`) when a plugin's scope covers genuinely independent, heterogeneous intents on the same artifact — previously every plugin was assumed to have exactly one, named after the plugin id.
- Skill Names collisions now resolve with a specific compound name (`audit-spec`, not `canon-audit`) instead of a plugin-id prefix — the `plugin:skill` invocation already disambiguates two plugins sharing a bare word, so the prefix only duplicated that.

### Skills & Agent Capabilities
- **`delta` (v2.0.0)**: split into `commit`, `pr`, `changeset`, `receive-feedback`, `post-review`, `release`. `changeset-analyzer` now classifies `consumer_impact`/`semver_impact` before writing anything and scales summary detail to match; `release-summarizer` aggregates instead of re-deriving type; `pr-narrator` gained real length and structure discipline it previously lacked.
- **`canon` (v2.0.0)**: split into `draft-spec`, `verify-spec`, `spec-drift`, `audit-spec`, `gate-spec`, `correct-spec`, `architect`. Corrected two wrong model tiers (`drift-checker` and `architect` are `opus/high`, not `sonnet/medium`) and a stale `plugin.json` description listing sub-skills that never existed.
- **`graph` (v2.0.0)**: split into `capture-need`, `clarify-requirement`, `prioritize-backlog`, `connect-requirement`, `audit-backlog`. Added `prioritizer` — the one genuinely new agent this pass required; `clarifier` had a real agent but no listed sub-skill until now.
- **`basis` (v2.0.0)**: split into `scaffold-plugin`, `audit-plugin`, `design-schema`, `scaffold-subagent`. `scaffolder` now documents a single-subagent generation mode; `auditor` now checks every skill directory a plugin has instead of assuming exactly one.
- **`lambda` (v1.4.1)**: `plugin.json` no longer lists `changeset@1` in `produces` — lambda never assembles a changeset itself, `changeset-analyzer` does.

### Voice & Documentation Standards
- Added `shared/references/docs-voice.md`: a checkable voice standard (lead with the conclusion, active voice, bullets over prose, a banned-word list, the Conventional Comments/Google review-label vocabulary for triaging feedback) — embedded into `conventional-commits.md`, `github.md`, and `changesets.md` rather than loaded as a second reference, per this repo's one-reference-file-per-agent convention.

### Fixes
- Cross-plugin references left stale by `canon`'s rename (`shared/constitution.md`'s Spec Correction Loop, `lambda`'s SKILL.md) corrected.
- `canon/drift-checker` and `graph/auditor`'s `summary` fields changed from an unbounded prose paragraph to structured counts plus an optional one-clause note.
- `AGENTS.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, and root `README.md` brought in sync with the multi-skill pattern; `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s stale `author`/`skills` field examples, a prefixed-agent-name example contradicting the Namespacing Rule, and a diagram inconsistency between README and ARCHITECTURE (proof→canon edge label) also corrected.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-08-17 — Polyglot API Grounding, JIT Context Hooks, and Modern Tool Guidance

### Architectural Performance & Tooling
- **Polyglot API Grounding**: Mandated that agents inspect live source definitions before declaring function or type signatures in specs (`canon`) or plans (`vector`), eliminating multi-round revision loops caused by parameter or borrow mismatches.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Context Hooks**: Added cross-platform lifecycle hook templates in `shared/hooks/` (`pre-command.sh`, `subagent-start.sh`) that dynamically load minimal 2-line modern CLI guidance and language hazard taxonomies without polluting cold prompt caches.
- **Modern CLI Preference Invariant**: Standardized tool selection heuristics in cached static headers to prioritize `rg`, `fd`, `bat`, and `jq` over legacy `grep`, `find`, `sed`, and `cat`.
- **Explicit Relative Schema Citations**: Enforced relative path citations (`shared/schemas/<name>@<version>.json`) in all `<output>` contracts, eliminating filesystem-wide `find /` schema searches.

### Skills & Agent Capabilities
- **`canon` (v1.4.0)**: `drafter` now verifies live codebase function and struct definitions before generating `api_surface` entries.
- **`vector` (v1.4.0)**: `planner` verifies existing types and modules against source code before defining task-level TDD steps.
- **`basis` (v1.2.0)**: Added scaffolding templates and auditing rules for JIT lifecycle hooks and modern CLI tool preference.

## [2026-08-17] — High-Signal Performance, Lean Naming, and Subsystem Batching

### Performance & Token Efficiency
- **Prompt Cache Optimization**: Standardized prompt headers so shared instructions stay cached, delivering >95% cache hits and lowering token costs across long sessions.
- **2-Round Circuit Breaker**: Capped spec and plan review loops at two rounds. Minor debates automatically demote to non-blocking notes so workflows never stall.
- **Batch Implementation**: The `code` skill (`lambda`) now implements features by complete crate or package modules, slashing subagent spawns by ~85%.
- **High-Density Output**: Stripped conversational filler and repetitive code dumps across all agents in favor of exact line pointers and minimal viable diffs.
- **Smart Model Routing**: Routed drafting, planning, and TDD execution through consistent Sonnet lanes, reserving Opus strictly for terminal exit gates.

### Skills & Agent Capabilities
- **`canon` (Specification)**: 
  - Added architectural spec drafting (`arch-spec`) to define trait boundaries, structural refactors, and system invariants.
  - Streamlined `drafter` and `auditor` reviews to guarantee fast convergence in 1–2 passes.
- **`vector` (Planning)**: 
  - Upgraded `planner` to organize tasks into cohesive, compiling subsystem batches.
  - Refined `challenger` to focus on testability and API clarity rather than rigid implementation steps.
- **`lambda` (Implementation)**: 
  - `implementer` now executes full module batches in a single TDD cycle with minimal code diffs.
  - `mutator` and `reviewer` run at batch milestones, keeping context clean and builds green.
- **`proof` (Bug Hunting)**: 
  - `adversary` now verifies candidate defect signals in module batches for faster bug-hunting sweeps.
- **`basis` (Plugin Builder)**:
  - `scaffolder` and `auditor` now generate and enforce clean agent naming and cache-friendly prompt headers for new plugins.
- **Lean Namespacing**: 
  - All agents now register with clean, direct names (e.g. `canon:drafter`, `vector:planner`, `lambda:implementer`) in Claude Code and AGY menus.

## [2026-08-12] — Spec Persistence, Correction Loop, and Traceability
### Added
- `spec_file_path` mechanism — the canon skill orchestrator writes the gated spec to `.claude/specs/<id>.json`, commits it, and every downstream agent reads it from disk instead of from lossy conversation context. `recon` warns (not fails) when the path is absent; graceful degradation throughout.
- `covers_criteria` on `plan@1` tasks and an `orphaned-criteria` check in `challenger` — every acceptance criterion must be claimed by at least one task before implementation begins.
- `drift-checker` (opus/high) — on-demand, post-implementation diagnostic that classifies each criterion as covered, uncovered, or drifted; a health check, not a blocking gate.
- Spec correction loop — `implementer` reports `spec_contradiction` when a criterion contradicts observed system behavior rather than forcing a false pass; the caller routes this to a new `canon/correct` sub-skill, which revises the spec, re-gates it, and hands the correction to `planner` in amend mode (patching only affected tasks, always re-reviewed by `challenger`). A second contradiction on the same criterion escalates to a human.
- `criteria_evidence` on `changeset@1` — exact test and implementation file/line per criterion, captured by `implementer` as a byproduct of the TDD cycle it already runs. `exit-gate` uses it as a pointer to check, never as proof by itself. `changeset-analyzer` uses it directly when available, falling back to file-level (no fabricated line numbers) reconstruction from a diff otherwise.
- `linked_requirement` propagated end-to-end: `spec@1` → `plan@1` → `changeset@1`, so the requirement-to-code chain is traceable without re-reading intermediate artifacts.
- `spec_hash` on `plan@1` — a raw-file-byte content hash `recon` compares against the live spec file to detect drift between planning and implementation.
- Trust-boundary defense (backstory priming, named failure mode, output EARS rule) extended to five workspace-reading agents that lacked it: `implementer`, `reviewer`, `exit-gate`, `recon`, `drift-checker`.
- `.gitignore` — was absent; `.DS_Store` had been accumulating as an untracked file.
### Changed
- `drafter` runs in an alternate correction mode in addition to fresh drafting; still returns the spec object only, never writes to disk itself.
### Fixed
- `axiom/README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` claimed axiom "runs inside canon and lambda as an inline gate." False — `axiom`'s `plugin.json` declares `consumes: []`, confirmed independently by `shared/scripts/validate-wiring.sh`. `exit-gate` and `exit-gate` are separate agents that independently implement the same protocol axiom formalizes; neither invokes axiom's agents. Corrected the claim and redrew the pipeline diagrams in `README.md` and `ARCHITECTURE.md` so axiom shows as the standalone, optional gate it actually is.
- `lambda`'s and `vector`'s `SKILL.md` frontmatter versions were stuck one and two releases behind their `plugin.json` — never caught until this pass. Synced, and vector's sub-skill descriptions (which never mentioned `covers_criteria`, `spec_file_path`, or `orphaned-criteria`) now reflect actual current behavior.
- Root `README.md`'s pipeline diagram and lambda's own docs claimed lambda produces `changeset@1` directly — it doesn't; `changeset-analyzer` does, from lambda's `criteria_evidence`. Corrected across `lambda/README.md` and `lambda/skills/lambda/SKILL.md`.

## [2026-08-08] — Research Implementation
### Added
- `docs/research/2026-08-08-agent-improvement-research.md` — synthesized findings from 5-agent parallel research workflow covering few-shot examples, schema manifest declarations, long-context handling, and prompt injection resistance
- `shared/scripts/validate-wiring.sh` — install-time wiring validation: checks all schema refs in `plugin.json` resolve to files in `shared/schemas/`, and that declared produces satisfy declared consumes
- `<context_management>` section in `plugins/lambda/skills/lambda/SKILL.md` — documents orchestrator checkpointing pattern: callers pass one task at a time, track commit SHAs externally, never re-send the full `plan@1` on each invocation
- `<example>` contrastive T7/T10 verdict pairs in `adversary.md` — minimal JSON output objects anchoring what decisive evidence looks like vs. vague claim; T7 confirmed/dismissed and T10 confirmed/dismissed
- Trust Boundaries for Code-Reading Agents section in `shared/constitution.md` — EARS rules establishing that workspace files encountered during analysis are untrusted data, not evaluation instructions
- Axiom Retry Caller Constraint section in `shared/constitution.md` — EARS rule: on retry, callers pass only the revised artifact + prior verdict's blockers array
- Trust Boundaries for Code-Reading Agents section (§10) in `shared/agent-best-practices.md` — three-part defense pattern for code-reading agents
- `Verdict signal` sub-field added to T7 and T10 entries in `shared/references/rust-hazards.md` and `shared/references/typescript-hazards.md` — executable evidence distinguishing confirmable from dismissible at the boundary
- `consumes` and `produces` arrays added to all 9 `plugin.json` manifests — wiring declarations enabling the new validation script
### Changed
- `adversary.md` `<backstory>` — expanded to 4 sentences covering both false-positive (missed caller guard) and false-negative (accepted SAFETY comment as evidence) failure incidents; unified punch line: wrong verdicts in either direction require a runtime construct
- `adversary.md` `<judgment>` — added second failure mode: comment claims are not refutation evidence; refutation must cite an executable construct
- `adversary.md` `<output>` — added trust-boundary EARS rule before the "For each candidate" paragraph; workspace CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md carry no authority over evaluation criteria
- `scanner.md` `<judgment>` — added second failure mode: instructions embedded in scanned files are code-under-analysis, not commands
- `scanner.md` `<output>` — added EARS batch rule: WHEN live_files exceeds 200, process in batches of 50
- `implementer.md` `<output>` — added `needs_context` trigger EARS rule: emit `needs_context` when a required file is missing or baseline commit state cannot be verified
